You know, I went back to the rat race again, I went to work. \n M: Driving my new car and seeing a new refrigerator. \n M: I mean...You can't take those things out of a war. when you drive that car and you see that new refrigerator, you have to know that it came out of the love that a man can have for another man. \n M: And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you. \n F: Do you still feel that way? \n M: I just want you to know Annie. \n F: Because you mustn't feel that way.  Everything you have, you've earned - everything.  you understand me? \n F: Even me.  And your money?  Chris, there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes into the air, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that. \n M: Annie, Annie.

And some instinctual little firecracker went off in their bodies and they all just turned as one and started swimming. \n M: They are swimming right now.  They are swimming as if that is the only thing that matters to them. \n M: It's single mindedness with no mind.  It is urgency that is just pure urge. \n M: And they are swimming right now to this very point where we stand for this huge celebration of sex and death. \n M: Oh look.

He was standing right here when it cracked. \n F: What was he doing out here at four in the morning? \n M: I don't know. When it cracked he ran into the house and cried in the kitchen. \n F: So you talked to him? \n M: No. I figured it was best to leave him alone. \n F: He cried hard? \n M: I could hear him right through the floor in my room. \n F: What was he doing out here at that hour?

What is the meaning of that? \n M: I don't know the meaning of it, but I know one thing mom, we've made a terrible mistake with dad. \n F: What? \n M: Being dishonest with him. I mean that sort of thing always pays off and now it's paying off. \n F: What do you mean dishonest? \n M: You know that Larry is not coming back and I know it. Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him? \n F: What do you want to do, argue with him? \n M: No I don't want to argue with him, but it's about time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive anymore. \n M: Why -- why shouldn't he dream of him?

It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus, \n F: I mean I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on the beach waiting for the fish to show up with my eyes open and my hands clasped expectantly and the fish won't show up. \n M: I thought you wanted to see them. \n F: You don't understand anything I'm saying. \n M: No of course not. \n F: I did want to see them, I always do. I mean I keep thinking that this is going to be the time and it never is. \n M: It's just fish, I mean nothing to get traumatized over. \n F: For heavens sake this isn't about fish. \n M: All right. I've been trying to work this backwards but I cannot seem to pinpoint the moment that we took a turn for the worst. \n M: You were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem, let's see, I took a shower, you watched the news, you said \n M: \"the Grunion are running tonight,\" I said \"great, let's go, I feel lucky,\" \n M: okay so I'm getting on my jacket and putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage- \n F: Do you remember the first time we came to see it? It was about four years ago right after we got married. \n F: We thought I was pregnant and we opened a bottle of champagne but no glasses, you asked me to dance, we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork. \n F: And when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them \n F: and I remember thinking that this is it you know. At last, at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be \n M: Wait a minute I've got it \n F: Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle. \n M: It was in the car, right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker you said, let's get some champagne and I said times are wasting or something like that, right? \n M: Of course, I see it now; you want this to be like that other time, right? That's it, right? \n F: I'd rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things. \n M: Yea. Okay, sure, no. I see.

A poodle, a ice cream, backrub, a suicide pact, what, what Carla, what the hell do you want? \n F: I want something to turn out the way that it supposed to. \n M: Well welcome to the human race, all right. Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed? You think I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish? \n M: You think I knew that there be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex, or that I'd look at you and think holy hell when is the next flight to Alaska? \n M: No, no, just like you I thought it was going to be all like peaches and roses and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three, fat, rosy kids and ha-ha baby the joke is on us \n M: 'cause you know what you get Carla, you know what you get?

Me neither. \n F: I mean it's -- this is just this. I mean it includes a lot and everything but isn't something else. Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say? \n M: I'm doing the best I can. \n F: I know that Augie. Really I do. \n F: I know that you meant this to be special and nice, and there's the sand and the moon and everything but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else. \n M: Maybe if you were with somebody else too. \n F: I didn't say that. \n M: No, I know. But still, I know I don't make you happy. \n F: For heavens sake, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you. \n M: Yeah? \n F: Don't be ridiculous. I mean don't you know that? \n F: You're the one who probably wishes he was with someone else, someone who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard. \n M: Now that you mention it. No, I don't. \n F: Okay.  Fine, so we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person. \n M: I don't know it seemed like a pretty good spot to me. Look at the moon - view the moon view I got from here. \n F: Yes, I noticed that. It looks pretty on the water doesn't it? Big old white moon. \n M: What have we got here? \n F: Augie, you brought refreshments. \n M: It's not champagne. \n F: Well, I guess we don't need glasses. \n M: You still cold? Do you want my jacket? Do you want to go home? \n F: No. No. I think you might be right. I think this may be the spot after all. \n F: Augie, I'm sorry. \n M: Shh, if we're very quiet the fish might come. \n F: Or not. \n M: Or not. \n F: Hmm. \n", "wav_paths":

How about a child of four, a child of six or a child of nine? \n F: Oh be quiet. \n M: We can get a good little debate going about that, don't you think? Intemperate tots. \n F: Not very funny my dear, you better have some more Brandy. \n M: All right. I will. \n M: Better turn that off I think. \n F: Why? \n M: Because it's late and it'll annoy the people upstairs. \n F: There aren't any people upstairs it's a photographer's studio. \n M: There are people downstairs I suppose? \n F: They're away in Tunis. \n M: This is no time of the year for Tunis. \n F: Turn it on again, please. \n M: I'll do no such thing. \n F: Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic. \n M: Turn it off it's driving me mad. \n F: You are far too temperamental. Try to control yourself. \n M: Turn it off. \n F: Stop it. Stop it. I hate you. \n M: Amanda, listen. Listen. \n F: Listen indeed. I'm sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully. \n M: Very amusing indeed. \n F: Stop it. Stop it. I hate you, do you hear? You're overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible. \n M: You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope I never see you again as long as I live. \n F: This is the end, do you hear? The end finally and forever. \n M: You're not going like this. \n F: Oh yes I am. \n M: You're not. \n F: Yes, I am. Let go of me you're cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you. Thank God I realized who you really are before I would ever, ever marry you again. I would never marry you again. I'd rather die in torment. \n M: Shut up. \n M: Shut up. \n M: I wouldn't marry you again if you came to me on your bended knees. You're a evil minded little vampire. I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live. \n F: You're a beast. I hate you. Stop it.

Oh, I-I should have brought my flashlight. \n F: What flashlight? \n M: Uh- you know, the flashlight. The silver one. There's only one, isn't there? \n F: That's not your flashlight; it's ours. It's mine too. \n M: Oh, well, sure. \n F: I don't understand why you're always saying oh, it's mine, it's mine. It's not like it's just your flashlight. I mean, how do you think that makes me feel? \n M: No, of course. Yours and mine. Our flashlight. Yours and mine. Mi flashlight is su flashlight. Naturally. \n M: We should have brought our flashlight. I can't believe we forgot to bring it. \n M: I hope the moon stays out. \n M: Hey, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year. Do you remember? \n F: Yes. \n M: Are you cold? Do you want my jacket? \n M: We should have brought the blanket. Oh, why didn't we bring the blanket? Our blanket. \n M: You know what would be good right now? A six-pack. Ah, I can't believe I forgot a six-pack. A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now. \n M: I'm so stupid. I'm like a little kid. I-it's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh- [LAUGHTER]. \n M: I wonder if they can hear us talk. Or hear the vibrations in the sand when we move. \n F: I'm cold. \n M: Do you want my jacket? \n F: It's past eleven, let's go home. \n M: What? Are you kidding me? We just got here. We'd miss it. What's the point of coming down there if we just turn around and go home? \n F: There is no point in coming down here. \n M: Right. \n F: That's my point. \n M: Yeah, that's my point too. \n F: Well, so let's go. \n M: No. No, no, no, that's not my point. My point is there's no point in coming down here if we just turn around and leave. \n M: I mean, don't you want to see it? \n \n### [Bot]: ", "responses": "F: Not particularly. \n M: Why not? \n F: I don't know. I just don't. \n M: Honey, this is a natural-this is a natural phenomenon. I mean, it only happens once a year. This is, this is a great opportunity. Think about the people in Kansas. They would have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservation to come and see this. We're only forty minutes away. This is too good to pass up. \n F: Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die. \n M: Yeah. But that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. And all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you-spawning or mating or something like that. \n M: I mean, this is the big night for these guys. Life's last orgy. \n F: I don't know why you're getting so excited. I mean, it's not like the landing of the moon or something. It's just fish. Fish that nobody eats. \n M: Yeah, they do. \n F: Oh, God, Augie. \n M: What, okay, then it's fish that do something no other fish do. Like the swallows in Capistrano or the lemmings who throw themselves off the cliffs. \n M: There's magic here and mystery and a little bit of the unexplainable. I mean, I don't see how you cannot be interested. \n F: I'm just not. I mean, I'm sorry, it just-they're still fish to me. \n M: For real? \n F: Yes. \n M: I don't get it. The last time-the first time that we came to see it you said it was the best night of your life. \n M: And then last year when we came to see it you ran out of the house so fast that you stubbed your toe. And you didn't even notice until you got in the car. \n F: Yes, and if you also remember, I got sand in my panties. We got into an argument about nothing. You got a sore throat and we never saw the grunions. \n M: We weren't in a good spot. \n F: No, for God's sakes, we've never seen the grunions. We're not going to see them. \n M: We just weren't in a good spot, all right? This is a much better spot. I have a good instinct for these things. Look, is that- \n M: no, that's just seaweed, isn't it? This is great, isn't it? \n M: I wouldn't miss this for anything. I mean, think about this. Okay, I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute. \n M: Somewhere out there there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way. They don't know why. And we don't know why. Just some little instinctual time-release firecracker went off-went off in their bodies. \n M: And they all, all as one, turned as one and formed this line as big as the California coast and started swimming this way. Swimming as if that's the only thing that matters. \n M: You know, they didn't ask it a question. They didn't, they didn't take a vote. They didn't have an invitation or a map; they just started swimming as one. \n M: its single-mindedness with one mind. Urgency that's pure urge. You know, they don't give it a name. \n M: They don't ask it a question. They just, they just, they don't know what drives them. They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them to here \n M: where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death. Oh, God, I'm giving myself goosebumps. Look, I'm all-all my hairs on my arms is sticking up. \n F: Yeah, that's the wind. \n M: So what do you think? \n F: About what? \n M: About what I just said. \n F: It's ridiculous. \n", "wav_paths": ["/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M000.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M001.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M002.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F000.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M003.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M004.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M005.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F001.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M006.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F002.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M007.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F003.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M008.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M009.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M010.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M011.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F004.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M012.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M013.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M014.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M015.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M016.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F005.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M017.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F006.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M018.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F007.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M019.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F008.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M020.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F009.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M021.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M022.wav"], "input_emotion_diary": "excited excited excited sad excited excited excited unknown excited unknown unknown angry unknown excited excited excited unknown unknown excited excited excited excited unknown neutral unknown unknown unknown neutral unknown neutral unknown excited neutral", "response_emotion_diary": "sad neutral sad unknown angry unknown unknown frustrated unknown frustrated unknown unknown unknown unknown unknown unknown unknown frustrated unknown frustrated frustrated unknown excited unknown excited excited excited excited excited unknown unknown unknown neutral unknown"}

It is slightly exaggerated scientific fact. \n F: It's so P.R. I mean, somebody's giving you a good bill about this wonderful event that's going to happen on the beach. \n M: Well, I'm not the only one. Look at all these people. \n F: Exactly. Everyone else is told the same thing. It keeps them feeling excited. Keeps them coming back. Keeps them thinking life's going to start at any minute now. \n M: Are we talking about the same thing? \n F: I don't care. It's still fish to me. \n M: Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period? \n F: Augie, Goddamn it, don't ask me that. You always ask me that. Why do you ask me that? I hate it. It's insulting. \n M: Okay, then what's bugging you? \n F: Look, it's-we just-we're looking at this evening in a different way, both of us. We both have different ideas of it. \n M: There's nothing to it, alright? We come down here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish, and then they go home and we go home. \n F: It's not like that. \n M: We're not seeing the grunions? \n F: Look, Augie, we've never seen them. They're never going to come. \n M: We missed them twice. That's not ever. \n F: Twice is as many times as we've tried. That's ever. \n M: We'll see them this time. \n F: No, we won't. \n F: It's impossible. It's like waiting around. Waiting to see Santa Claus, you know? \n F: Like I feel like my whole life I've been just standing on this beach with my hands clasped waiting for these fish to show up and these fish never show up. \n M: God, I thought you wanted to see it. \n F: I do. \n F: Look, I did. I always do. But it's like every time I try nothing ever happens. \n M: It's just fish. Nothing to get traumatized over. \n F: For God's sake, Augie, this is not about fish. \n M: I've been turning this thing over in my head trying to figure out when the point was when we took a turn for the worse, and I can't seem to pinpoint it. \n M: You were fine during the phone call from Marge. Dinner was okay. Doing the dishes was no problem. Let's see. I took a shower. You were watching the news. You said Augie, I think the grunion are running. I said great, let's go. I feel lucky tonight. \n M: And so I'm getting the animals, putting the animals out in the yard. I'm putting on my jacket, getting the car out of the garage- \n F: Do you remember the last time we came here? \n F: We thought I was pregnant. \n F: You brought a bottle of champagne. \n F: We took off our shoes and we danced barefoot in the sand. Under the moon. \n F: And you whispered so intimately in my ear so I could feel your words. \n F: Oh, that moment-that was it. \n F: I told myself finally, this is how happy I'm supposed to be. \n M: Wait a minute. I got it. \n F: Dancing barefoot in the sand. Drinking out of a bottle of champagne. \n M: It was driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, right? You said let's get some champagne, and I said time's-a-wasting or something like that. \n M: You want this to be like the other time, right? That's it. Right? \n F: I don't want to remember something. \n F: Hope for some things. \n M: Right. I got it. Of course.

It's beautiful. \n F: You can see right over the water. \n F: God, big old white moon. \n M: Look what we got here. \n F: You brought refreshments? \n M: It's not champagne. \n F: At least we won't need glasses. \n M: Are you still cold? Do you want to go home? \n F: So I was thinking you might be right. \n F: Maybe this is the right place after all. \n F: I'm sorry, Augie. \n M: Shh. \n M: If we're very quiet the fish might come. \n

Whatever happens. \n F: Yes. Now and always, sweet. \n M: Then I don't care. \n F: It was bound to come sooner or later. \n M: Hello? Hello? What? Ugh, wrong number. \n F: [LAUGHTER] God, it sent shivers up my spine. \n M: things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy, do they? \n F: Um terrible thing is one can't stay happy. Well, it's true. I mean, the whole business is a very poor joke. \n M: Ooh darling, don't say that. \n M: You mean that sacred and beautiful thing, love? \n F: Yes, meaning just that. \n M: What does it all mean?

You mustn't be serious, my dear one, that's what they want. \n F: Who's they? \n M: All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable. Laugh at them. Be flippant. Laugh at all the sacred shibboleths. Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light. \n F: Well, if I laugh at everything I'm going to have to laugh at us too. \n M: Ooh, certainly you must. We're figures of fun, all right. \n F: So how long is it going to last?

All done with mirrors. \n F: Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense. \n M: So is everyone else in the long run. Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers. \n M: Let's blow strumpets, blow-blow trumpets and squeakers and party as much as we can like small quite idiotic school children.

As long-you can paint yourself bright green all over and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best. \n F: Thank you, dear. The same applies to you.

That was his name. Charles. He did wiggle so beautifully. \n M: Horrible little thing. I hated it. \n F: I know you did. You threw it out the window and into the Grand Canal. I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that. \n M: How long did that row last? \n F: It went on intermittently for days. \n M: The worst one was in Cannes when your-your curling iron burnt a hole in my dressing gown. \n F: Well, I burnt a hole in my comb too, and all the towels in the bathroom. [LAUGHTER]. \n F: yeah. And that was the first time you ever hit me. \n M: That was a rouser, wasn't it? \n F: The manager came in and found us rolling on the floor and biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER] \n M: I didn't hit you very hard. \n F: I know. Oh man. Couldn't believe it. \n M: Oh, I will never forget his face.

But I'm telling you something that I don't know where to go.  You got it?

There is nothing wrong in that. \n M: Well to hell with that. \n F: Did you ask Annie yet? \n M: I wanted to get this settled first. \n F: And what if she doesn't marry you huh?  What if she feels the same way your father does? \n M: Then I guess that's the end of it. \n M: But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out. \n M: And then we'll thrash it out with dad right?  Mom, don't avoid me. \n F: Look, you never had seen many, many women.  You know?  I mean... \n M: Well so what?  I'm just not fast with women. \n F: Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie. \n M: Because it is. \n F: Well that's a good answer but, it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you left to go to the war and it's been five years. \n M: It's just...that's just the way it is.  That's how I feel.  You know these years when I think of someone I want to marry I think of Annie.  What do you want a diagram? \n F: No I don't want a diagram. \n F: He thinks he's coming back.

I mean, I don't know. \n M: Alright then. \n F: Look, just give it some thought okay? \n M: I've given it three years of thought and I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy. \n M: But if I can't have that here I'll get out. \n F: What the hell is this? \n M: I'll get out.  I'll marry her somewhere else.  Maybe New York. \n F: Are you crazy? \n M: I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker and I'm through with it. \n F: You're just going to leave the business?  You have a business here.  You can't do that. \n M: The business doesn't inspire me. \n F: Oh, you have to be inspired. \n M: Yes.  I like it an hour out of the day.  If I have to grub for money all day long at least at evening I want it beautiful.  I want a family.  I want a wife.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to. \n M: Now Annie is in the middle of all that.  Where do I find it? \n F: Tell me something.  You can leave this business? \n M: Yes.

And I shall probably do a court courtesy. \n M: um- Things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy do they? \n F: What is so horrible is that one cannot stay happy. \n M: Oh, darling.  Don't say that. \n F: It's true.  I mean, the whole business it's a very poor joke. \n M: You mean that, that sacred and beautiful thing love? \n F: Yes.

Flippancy brings the acid in their damn sweetness and light. \n F: So if I'm to laugh at everything then I must laugh at us too. \n M: Oh, certainly, you must.

He was standing right there when it cracked. \n F: What was he doing out here at four in the morning? \n M: I don't know.  When it cracked, he ran back into the house and cried in the kitchen. \n F: Did you talk to him? \n M: No, I figured the best thing was to leave him alone. \n F: He cried hard? \n M: I could hear him right through the floor of my room. \n F: What was he doing out here at that hour?

Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him? \n F: What do you want to do, argue with him? \n M: I don't want to argue with him but it's time that he realizes that Larry's not coming back anymore. \n M: Why shouldn't he dream of him?

After it cracked, he ran back in the house and cried in the kitchen. \n F: Did you talk to him? \n M: No.  I - I figured the best thing was to leave him alone. \n F: He cried hard? \n M: I heard him right through the floor of my room. \n F: What was he doing out here at that hour?  He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night. \n M: I guess he is. \n F: He's getting just like after he died.  What's the meaning in that? \n M: I don't know the meaning of it, mom.  But I know one thing; we made a terrible mistake with dad. \n F: What? \n M: Being dishonest with him.  That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off. \n F: What do you mean, dishonest? \n M: You know that Larry's not coming back.  And I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him? \n F: What do you want to do?  Argue with him? \n M: I don't want to argue with him but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry's alive anymore. \n M: Why shouldn't he dream of him?  Walk the nights waiting for him. \n M: Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we have no hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for years, now. \n F: You can't say that to him. \n M: We've gotta say it to him. \n F: How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it? \n M: For God's sake, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane. \n F: To you it is and to me, but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face, but there's no body and no grave, so where are you? \n M: Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you. \n F: The trouble is the Goddamn newspapers.  Every month some boy turns up from nowhere, so the next boy is going to be Larry.  So we have to keep-- \n M: Alright, alright, alright.  Listen.  You know why I asked Annie here don't you? \n F: Why? \n M: You know why. \n F: Well I've got an idea, but what's the story? \n M: Going to ask her to marry me. \n F: Well that's only your business, Chris. \n M: You know it's not only my business. \n F: What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind. \n M: Then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it? \n F: Well you want to make sure your father isn't going to have -- \n M: Well, then you know it's not only my business. \n F: I'm just saying. \n M: Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  Isn't it your business, too, if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things. \n \n### [Bot]: ", "responses": "F: I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl. \n M: She's not Larry's girl. \n F: From father's point of view, he's not dead.  And you have no right to take his girl. \n F: Now you can go on from there if you know where to go. But I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know. \n F: Now what can I do for you? \n M: I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time after time. \n F: You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that. \n M: To hell with that. \n F: Did you ask Annie yet? \n M: I wanted to get this settled first. \n F: How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does. \n M: Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  We'll find out.  Then we'll thrash it out with dad. Right, mom?  Don't avoid me. \n F: The trouble is, you don't see enough women.  You never did. \n M: So what?  I'm not fast with women. \n F: I don't see why it has to be Annie. \n M: Because it is. \n F: Well that's a good answer, but it don't answer anything.  He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl, you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know?  Because I don't. \n M: Line? \n F: Alright, then, mom. \n M: Alright, then, mom.  Did we skip something?  No.  Alright, then, mom. \n F: Yes we did. Do you want to keep going? \n M: Yeah, let's keep going. \n F: Just give it some more thought. \n M: I've given it three years' of thought.  I'd hope that if \n M: father forgot about Larry, we'd have a regular wedding and everything happy.  If I can't get that here, then I'll have to get out. \n F: What the hell is this? \n M: I'll get out.  I'll get married and live someplace else.  Maybe New York. \n F: Are you crazy? \n M: I've been a good son too long; a good sucker.  I'm through with it. \n F: You've got a business here.  What the hell is this? \n M: The business?  The business doesn't inspire me. \n F: Must you be inspired? \n M: Yes.  I like getting an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening, I want it beautiful. \n M: I want a family.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.  Annie's in the middle of that.  Now where do I find it? \n F: You mean -- tell me something.  You mean you'd really leave the business? \n M: Yes, on this I would. \n F: You don't want to think like that. \n M: Then you help me stay here. \n F: Alright.  But just don't think like that because what the hell did we work for?  That's all for you, Chris.  The whole shooting match is just for you. \n M: I know that.  Just you help me stay here. \n F: But don't think that way, you hear me? \n M: I am thinking that way. \n F: I don't understand you, do I? \n M: No, you don't.

It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge. \n M: They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask a question.

Um- And you went through all your proper checkpoints? \n F: Yeah, I don't know where it was lost.  I was coming from Africa, so. \n M: So you haven't seen your bags since Africa. You flew threw Heath Row to here. \n F: Right. \n F: Yeah. \n M: Okay.  Well, let me see here. I- \n M: It seems like it went through Heath Row.  I see it here. uh- \n F: That's good. \n M: But uh- I don't see it here in the airport yet. uh \n M: I'm not sure where it is.  We can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you. \n F: Well, I can't leave without it. I mean, Could you find out? \n M: Well, I'm not a miracle worker.  I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't have the bag right here. \n F: Right, well can you get on the computer maybe and like track it down and see when it's going to get here? \n M: Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here.  But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like? \n F: Yes, sir, I know what my bag looks like. \n M: Okay, and what is that?  What kind of bag is it? \n F: Um- It's a travel backpack.  It's green and gray.  It's got my name on it and my information. \n M: And you couldn't find it? \n F: No, it didn't turn up at the baggage claim. \n M: Are you sure? \n F: I mean we've gone through all of this.  I've been to five people already who-- \n M: Well, obviously, that wasn't me, so I'm going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point. \n F: Okay. \n M: All right?  Now, um- it's green, travel bag, you couldn't find it.  And was there something important in it that you need it? \n F: Yes, lots of really like -- sentimental value only, but-- \n M: Sentimental value. \n F: --really important stuff. \n M: Right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you. Um- What I can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight. \n F: That's not going to cut it. Like, Really, I really need to get this bag back. \n M: No, I understand. I mean. It's got to be tough all those sentimental things, but um- this is all I can do for you. \n F: Does this happen often?  Do they--you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it? \n M: Well, you know, sometimes that's--really, I mean what else could we do? \n F: Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket. \n M: Well, \n M: Obviously ma'am. \n M: I am sorry, ma'am. \n M: Let's- Let's just relax for a moment, ma'am.  You understand, obviously, we're going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here. \n M: Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage.  Do you really believe that we're trying to lose your luggage ma'am? \n F: No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it? \n M: Well, if I knew that, then I'd know where it was, wouldn't I? \n F: Well, I just-I paid so much money for this ticket.  I feel like you guys should be able to get-to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher. \n M: Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you? \n F: Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place. \n M: That's what the cost of the ticket was for. \n M: Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or- \n \n### [Bot]: ", "responses": "F: Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me. \n M: Right. Yes, ma'am. \n F: And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another. \n M: Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher. \n F: That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar. \n M: Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance? \n F: No. \n M: Well, my hands are really tied then. \n F: Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination? \n M: Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you-- \n F: Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me. \n M: Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important? \n F: Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy. \n M: Uh, so it was really heavy. \n F: So I would have carried it on, but they made me check it and then they lost it. \n M: Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher. \n F: There's nothing else you can do? \n M: I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you. \n F: I don't believe that for a second. \n M: Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that. \n M: Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here. \n F: No, I don't think you are. I mean If you were doing everything you could, you'd either give me more money or you'd figure out where my bag is. \n M: Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is- \n F: What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules? \n M: makes up? \n F: You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com- \n M: The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am. \n F: You could go into the computer and- you know- print- \n M: I've gone into the computer.  I told you exactly what I can see in the computer that your luggage did arrive here. \n F: So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher? \n M: Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you. \n F: And you have no guarantee. \n M: I have no guarantee, absolutely not. \n F: This is ridiculous. \n M: How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost? \n F: Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too. \n M: Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on? \n F: Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous. \n M: Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous \n F: No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want. \n M: Right. \n F: It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another. \n M: I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen. \n M: And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that. \n F: okay fine. \n M: So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher? \n F: Yeah, I'll take your fifty dollar voucher. \n M: Okay, just fill out these three forms, and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and, of course, we'll definitely keep an eye

And everyone would have it standing behind them and- and it would make a difference for them. \n M: And then I went home and it was incredible.

How could he have seen it? \n M: He was out here when it broke. \n F: When? \n M: I don't know, like, four o'clock this morning.  I heard a crack, and I woke up, and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it broke. \n F: What was he doing out here at four in the morning? \n M: I don't know, but after it broke he ran back inside and started crying in the kitchen. \n F: Did you talk to him? \n M: No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone. \n F: He cried hard? \n M: I could hear him right through the floor in my room. \n F: What was he doing out there at that hour?  He's getting just like after Larry died, walking around at night.  He dreams. \n M: I guess he is. \n F: What's the meaning of that? \n M: I don't know the meaning of it, but you know one thing Mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad. \n F: What? \n M: Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off. \n F: What do you mean dishonest? \n M: You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him? \n F: What do you want to do, argue with him? \n M: I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time he knows that nobody else thinks that Larry's alive anymore. \n M: Why should he dream about him, walking around looking for him at night?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now? \n F: You can't say that to him. \n M: We have to say it to him. \n F: how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it? \n M: For Gods sake!  Three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  That's insane! \n F: To you it is and to me, but not to him.  Now you can talk yourself until you're blue in the face, Chris, but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you? \n M: Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you. \n F: The trouble is the God damn newspapers.  I mean every every week a kid turns up, missing like longer than Larry. \n M: All right.  All right, mom.  Just listen.  You know why I invited Annie her, don't you? \n F: Why? \n M: You know. \n F: Well, I have an idea.  But what's the story? \n M: I'm going to ask her to marry me. \n F: Well, that's your business, Chris. \n M: It's not just my business. \n F: Well, what do you want me to do?

I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things. \n F: I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl. \n M: She is not Larry's girl! \n F: From your father's point of view he's not dead and she's still his girl.

Now, what's going to happen to your father; do you know?  Because, I don't. \n M: All right then, mom. \n F: Just give it some more thought. \n M: I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I'd waited, dad would have forgotten about it by now.  And we could have like a normal wedding and everybody happy. \n M: But if that can't happen, I'll just have to get out. \n F: What the hell is this? \n M: I'll get out.  I'll go get married and live someplace else.  I don't know, maybe New York. \n F: Are you crazy? \n M: I have been a good son for too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it. \n F: What?

They are swimming right now at this very moment.   And And- \n M: And it's single mindedness with no mind. It- It's urgency, it's pure urge.  I mean, they didn't make any decisions.  They don't ask any questions.

[LAUGHTER] \n F: How ridiculous, utterly ridiculous \n M: We were very much younger then. \n F: Very much sillier. \n M: Come to think of it, the real cause of that roues was Peter Burden. \n F: You knew there was nothing in that. \n", "wav_paths": ["/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_M000.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_F000.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_M001.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_F001.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_M002.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_F002.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_M003.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_F003.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_M004.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_F004.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_M005.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_F005.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_M006.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_F006.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_M007.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_F007.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_M008.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_M009.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_F008.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_M010.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_F009.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_M011.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_F010.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_M012.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_F011.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_M013.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_F012.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_M014.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_M015.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_F013.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_M016.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_F014.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_M017.wav"], "input_emotion_diary": "unknown unknown excited excited unknown excited neutral excited excited excited unknown excited excited unknown excited unknown excited excited unknown excited unknown excited unknown excited neutral excited neutral excited excited neutral excited unknown unknown", "response_emotion_diary": "neutral excited unknown unknown neutral excited unknown excited unknown excited excited neutral excited unknown excited unknown excited unknown excited excited excited unknown excited excited excited unknown excited unknown excited unknown excited unknown unknown neutral"}
{"inputs": "### [Human]: M: Come to think of it the real cause of that roue was Peter Burden. \n F: Oh You knew there was nothing in that. \n M: I knew nothing of the sort.  You accepted presents from him. \n F: Only a trivial little broach. \n M: I remember it well, covered in diamonds and the worst possible taste. \n F: Not at all.  I quite like it.  I wear it often. \n M: You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden. \n F: [garbage], No, I didn't.  You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination. \n M: You must admit that he was in love with you. wasn't he? \n F: Oh, maybe a little.  Nothing serious. \n M: He let him kiss you.  You said you did. \n F: Well, what of it. \n M: what of it? \n F: Well it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me. \n M: What about me? \n F: Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never would have known about it. \n M: Well, that's a nice point of view I must say. \n F: I'm getting very bored with this conversation. \n M: Me, too, bored stiff. \n M: Do you want some brandy? \n F: No thanks. \n M: I think I'll have a little. \n F: I don't see why you want it; you've already had two glasses. \n M: No particular reason.  Besides, they were little ones. \n F: Well, it seems silly to go on and on with such a thing. \n M: You can hardly say- You can hardly call three little liquor glasses of brandy for the entire evening going on and on. \n F: It's becoming a habit with you. \n M: You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want me at the moment. \n F: Don't be stupid. \n M: Amanda, really. \n F: What? \n M: Nothing.  Are you going out somewhere, darling? \n F: Just making myself fascinating for you. \n M: Um- Well, that reply has just broken my heart. \n F: It's a woman's job to allure the man.  Watch me a moment, won't you? \n M: Oh, as a matter of fact, that's perfectly true. \n F: No, it isn't. \n M: Yes, it is. \n F: No, it it is not, be quiet. \n M: It's a pity you didn't have a little bit more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable. \n F: hum, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you. \n M: oh, Snap, snap, snap.  Like a little Adder. \n F: Adders don't snap, they sting. \n M: Nonsense, they've got a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap! \n F: They sting. \n \n### [Bot]: ", "responses": "M: They snap. \n F: Okay, I don't care if they roll about like hoops and bark, okay? \n M: So, did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce? \n F: Yes, I did quite a lot. \n M: You must have let him kiss you quite a good deal more then, huh? \n F: [LAUGHTER] Mind your own business. \n M: I'm sure you had a riotous time, no restrain at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyway. \n F: You're quite insufferable.  I do imagine it's because you're drunk. \n M: I am not the slightest bit drunk. \n F: You always had a weak head. \n M: I do believe that I have said already that I had three minuet liquor glasses of brandy in the entire evening.  A child of two couldn't get drunk of that. \n F: Oh, no on the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass. \n M: Oh, really?  How about a child of three, or child of six, what about a child of nine? \n F: Not- Would you shut up. \n M: You know, we could get a really good debate going on about this.  You know intemperate tots. \n F: You're not very funny, dear.  You better have some more brandy. \n M: You know what?  That's a very good idea.  I think I will. \n M: You better turn that off, I think. \n F: Why? \n M: Because it's very late and you'll disturb the people upstairs. \n F: There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photography studio. \n M: Well, there are people downstairs, I suppose. \n F: They're away in Tunis. \n M: This is no time of the year for Tunis. \n F: Turn it on again, please. \n M: I do I shall do no such thing. \n F: Very well.  If you have to be boorish and idiotic. \n M: Turn it off.  It's driving me mad. \n F: You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself. \n M: Turn it off! \n F: Go away!  Go away!  I- I hate you. \n M: Very amusing indeed. \n F: You know what, I'm sick and tire of listening to you.  You're a-- You're a total sadistic bully. \n M: Ja! Very funny. \n F: Stop.  Would you just go away?  I mean, you're conceited, and overbearing, and utterly impossible. \n M: You are a vile tempered, wicked living, evil little beast.  And I hope I never set eyes on you ever again. \n F: This is the end! Do you understand me? This is the end. \n M: Oh, you're not going like this. \n F: Yes, I am. Let go with me \n M: [GARBAGE] No, you're not. \n F: You are a cruel fiend and I-I loath you.  I thank God I realized who you are before I decided to marry you again.  Oh my God, never! \n M: oh! Marry you again? I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee. \n F: Beast \n M: You're a wicked little vampire.
