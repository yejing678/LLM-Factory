It's a hint of empathy, a glimmer of understanding that suggests that she may not be as cold and uncaring as she seems.\nAnd with that thought, Mr. M turns and walks out of the office, feeling a sense of hope that he hasn't felt in a long time.

Okay.  That's not my point.  My point is there is no point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home.  Don't you want to see it? \n F: Not particularly. \n M: Why not? \n F: I just don't.  It's stupid. \n M: Honey, this is like a natural phenomenon. I mean... People in Kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this.  It's just forty minutes away for us; it's too good to pass up. \n F: Pass what up?  I mean these fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the beach, they swim away and then they die. \n M: Yeah.  But this..this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do - spawning or mating or whatever. \n M: This is a big night for these little guys.  It's like life's last orgy. \n F: I don't see why you're so excited; this isn't a freaking moon landing we are talking about.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats. \n M: Yeah they do. \n F: Oh Augie \n M: okay... well, Whatever.  But it's a fish who do something no other fish do.  It's like those swallows returning to Capistrano or like those lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs. \n M: There's like mystery here, there's magic.  It's like a little bit of the unexplainable.  I just can't see how you're not interested. \n F: I'm just not. \n M: For real? \n F: Yeah. \n M: God, I don't get it.  you know the first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life? \n M: And last year, I remember distinctly you said, you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car. \n F: Last time, you'll also remember, we got our shoes wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat and we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions. \n M: Ahh...we weren't in a good spot. \n F: Hmm.  We didn't see them the year before either. \n M: We just weren't in a good spot.  I'm telling you, this is a much better spot.  I have instincts for these things. \n M: Look there, see?  What's that?  No, that's - that's just seaweed. \n M: God, this is great.  Think about this.  I know you are not interested, but just think about this. \n M: Right now out there, there is this mass of silver fish and it's heading this way.  No one sent them an invitation, no one told them, no one even gave them a map. \n M: Just all at once, they turned and they formed this line as long as the California coast.  And some instinctual little firecracker went off in their bodies and they all just turned as one and started swimming. \n M: They are swimming right now.  They are swimming as if that is the only thing that matters to them. \n M: It's single mindedness with no mind.  It is urgency that is just pure urge. \n M: And they are swimming right now to this very point where we stand for this huge celebration of sex and death. \n M: Oh look.  I'm giving myself goose bumps, my hairs are standing up on my arm. \n F: That's the wind. \n M: So what do you think? \n F: About what? \n M: About all of that, about all I was talking about. \n", "audio": ["/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M000.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M001.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_F000.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M002.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M003.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_F001.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M004.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M005.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_F002.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M006.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_F003.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M007.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_F004.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M008.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_F005.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M009.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_F006.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M010.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_F007.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M011.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M012.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M013.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_F008.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M014.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M015.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M016.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_F009.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M017.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_F010.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M018.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_F011.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M019.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_F012.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M020.wav", "/home/jye/datasets/ERC/IEMOCAP/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_F013.wav"]}

Here are some suggestions for how you could continue the plot:\n1. The couple could continue to argue and reminisce about their past experiences, leading to a deeper understanding of their relationship and their expectations for the night.\n2. As they wait for the grunions to arrive, they could start to notice strange occurrences on the beach, such as strange lights in the distance or unusual sounds in the night.\n3. As the night wears on and the grunions fail to arrive, the couple could start to feel a sense of unease and disillusionment, leading to a dramatic confrontation.\n4. Just as they are about to give up, they could hear a strange noise in the distance, signaling the arrival of the grunions.\n5. As they watch the grunions arrive, they could have a moment of realization that the magic of the night is not just about the fish, but about the time and place they share together.\n6. The couple could decide to leave the beach and go on a new adventure together, using the lessons they learned from their failed grunion night to guide them.\n7. As they drive away from the beach, they could start to see the world in a new light, filled with possibilities and wonder.\n8. The couple could end up at a small coastal town, where they could find a new sense of purpose and belonging.\n9. As they explore the town, they could discover a hidden gem of a restaurant, where they could share a romantic dinner and reflect on their journey.\n10.
